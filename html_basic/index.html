    <h1>Welcome to My First Webpage</h1>
    <h2>About This Page</h2>
    <p>This is my very first webpage built with HTML as part of my ALX Software Engineering journey.</p>
    <p>I'm learning how to structure web content using different HTML tags like headings and paragraphs.</p>

    <h3>Fun Facts</h3>
    <p>I enjoy building cool stuff with code, especially when it helps solve real problems.</p>
    <p>One of my goals is to become a full-stack web developer and create useful applications for people in my community.</p>
